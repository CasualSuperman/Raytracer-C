Available targets:
    all (default):
        Compiles all dirty modules and links an execuable, ray. Runs all
        targets marked with a *.

    debug:
        Cleans the build area, then generates an executable with debug symbols
        included.

    profile:
        Build including profiling information. Runs clean first.

  * ray:
        Links an executable using the objects stored in ./obj/ Saves error
        information from the linking process in ./main.err

    nolink:    
        Runs analyze, then compiles all dirty modules. Like ray without the
        link step.
    
  * analyze:
        Runs clang, or splint to analyze the modules, and prints the output.

    clean:
        Removes all object, error, binary, and profiling files.

    help:
        Prints this information.

Available flags:
    DEBUG:
        Values include PIXEL, RAY, SPHERE, MEMORY and PLANE.
        Only availble when using the debug target.

        Example:
            make debug DEBUG="PIXEL PLANE MEMORY"

    HAS_CLANG:
        Set this to a value other than "clang" when invoking make to use gcc
        and splint.

This project will use clang to compile and do code analysis, if it is availble.
